Document Version 0.1

#### Description

## Main Features (0.1)
- Upon launching the app, users will see a staff (treble cleff), and a note placed upon it. 
- (Moved to next version) There will be an entry field below the image for users to select the note (A-G), sharpness (Natural, Sharp, Flat), and Octave (1-7).
- Once the user has selected their notes, they may click a "reveal" button which reveals the correct answer.
- The "reveal" button will then turn into a "next" button, and the process will repeat again, infinitely.
- There is an exit button on the top right to close the app.
